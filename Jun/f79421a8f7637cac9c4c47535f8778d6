In 2019, Plan International made the tough decision to close our office in Sri Lanka. During our 38 years in the country, we supported more than 500,000 children and their families in five provinces and hundreds of villages, managing projects to improve education, to combat violence against children and to promote equality. The decision to cease work in Sri Lanka was based on a number of factors that had a serious impact on our ability to continue our support programmes. These included: While we believe our decision to exit from Sri Lanka was the best course of action given the circumstances, it is clear that we made a number of mistakes during the exit process. We are truly sorry and apologise to the children, communities, donors and partners involved in our work in Sri Lanka who feel that we left abruptly and that our communication at the time was not sufficient or effective. It is very rare that we have to take the decision to exit from a country but given the legitimate concerns about the way we left Sri Lanka, we have undertaken a rigorous internal review of our practices and protocols to learn vital lessons to avoid such mistakes happening again, and to improve how we plan for such a scenario in the future. Important conclusions drawn from the review process include: We understand the need and desire to be fully trusted as an organisation and are committed to learning in order to keep improving. To this end, we are implementing the necessary changes to our internal decision making procedures while reinforcing our commitment across the organization to learn from this chapter in our history.
