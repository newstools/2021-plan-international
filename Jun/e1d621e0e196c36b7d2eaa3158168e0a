These children’s climate cards provide a series of inspiring and interactive activities to engage children on the climate change agenda and call for climate action. Each card has a fun climate craft mission to learn what climate change is, discover its global and local impacts, and get inspired by climate action stories. The goal is to inspire a call for climate action from children in every country in the world to hold decision makers accountable to children’s voices. The cards are for children in any country aged 7-12 years. They can be used at home, at school, at children’s clubs and in migration centres and camps. Each card take 30-60 minutes. It is suggested to complete 1 card per day over 2 weeks. If the cards are used in specific lessons, or sessions, they can also be used over a longer time period. We appreciate voluntary and anonymous feedback on the cards, which can be provided through this link and can be answered by children using the cards as well as educators, parents or facilitators. These cards were developed by Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, Children in a Changing Climate Coalition (Plan International, ChildFund Alliance, Save the Children, UNICEF and World Vision), Global Disaster Preparedness Centre, IFCE, British Red Cross and the UK Met Office. Children are the least responsible for creating global climate change but will bear the brunt of its effects. Plan International is supporting children to get their voices heard in the fight against the climate crisis and the need for resilience. One of the most devastating consequences of climate change will be a reversal of progress on girls’ rights and gender equality. These stories show how the inequalities experienced by marginalised girls and young women are amplified by the impacts of climate change.
