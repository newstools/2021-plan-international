Adolescent girls and young mothers in displacement settings in Ethiopia and Uganda are at high risk of child marriage. They form the group of young people with least access to humanitarian services such as education, livelihoods and health services. Married girls face high levels of violence and abuse, and worry about the future of their children. At the same time, adolescent girls and young mothers show remarkable resilience in coping with everyday hardships. Plan International’s Adolescent Programming Toolkit was used to consult with adolescent girls and young mothers with the aim to design an adolescent-responsive multi-year project in Ethiopia and Uganda. Adolescent girls and young mothers prioritised education, livelihoods, health and protection services, and highlighted how humanitarian actors can engage with their families, communities and services to meet their needs and priorities. The Adolescent Programming Toolkit has been designed to support frontline teams to work with and for adolescents in emergencies and protracted crises. It is based on programme evidence, numerous accounts from adolescents and good practices shared by frontline staff globally. Emergencies can have devastating effects on children’s lives, putting them at increased risk of abuse and neglect with adolescent girls among the most vulnerable. We believe adolescent girls’ specific needs must be addressed to reduce the impact of disaster and help them reach their potential.
