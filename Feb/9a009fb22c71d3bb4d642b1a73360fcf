Violence against children occurs globally and throughout the Asia region and takes place in all settings. Despite concerted efforts by many stakeholders, much of this violence remains hidden and under-reported. The Child-Sensitive Reporting Mechanisms toolkit “Speak Out –Be Protected!” identifies simple and user-friendly processes through which children and their peers (and families) can raise child protection concerns and report to the respective mandatory child protective agencies, services or trusted community groups/institutions. Violence can mean many different things. Physical abuse, psychological abuse, sexual abuse and neglect are the main types of violence covered in this manual. Every child has the right to feel safe, both at home and at school. Plan International is committed to protecting children from violence and working with the communities, schools and governments who can protect them from harm. Emergencies can have devastating effects on children’s lives, putting them at increased risk of abuse and neglect with adolescent girls among the most vulnerable. Plan International's safeguarding policy aims to make sure no child or young person who is associated with the organisation comes to any harm.
